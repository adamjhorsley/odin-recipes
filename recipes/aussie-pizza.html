            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>An Aussie pizza is a distinctive Australian take on the classic pizza, characterized by its unique combination of toppings. The base is typically 
            spread with tomato sauce and covered with a generous layer of mozzarella cheese. What sets this pizza apart is the inclusion of ham or bacon and the addition of eggs, which are cracked over the pizza before baking. These ingredients give the pizza a hearty, savory flavor, with the eggs adding a rich, creamy texture once cooked.</p>

            <p>Often, sliced onions are also added, providing an extra layer of flavor and a bit of crunch. While variations might include mushrooms, bell peppers, or even pineapple, the defining elements remain the ham or 
            bacon, eggs, and cheese. This blend of ingredients reflects Australia's love for robust and satisfying meals, making the Aussie pizza a popular choice in pizzerias across the country.</p>

            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 220°C (430°F) or according to the pizza dough package instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the rolled dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spread the Sauce:</strong> Evenly spread a layer of tomato sauce over the pizza dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add the Cheese:</strong> Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the tomato sauce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add the Toppings:</strong> Arrange slices of ham or strips of bacon evenly over the cheese. Scatter thinly sliced onions over the pizza.</li>
                    <li><Strong>Crack the Eggs:</Strong> Carefully crack 2-3 eggs over the pizza, ensuring they are evenly spaced out. The eggs will cook in the oven, creating a rich and creamy texture.</li>
                    <li><strong>Optional Toppings:</strong> If using optional ingredients like mushrooms, bell peppers, or pineapple, add them now.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown, the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the eggs are cooked to your desired doneness.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cool and Serve:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
